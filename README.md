Hi, I’m schweby.  
It’s suspected that I’m three raccons in a trenchcoat. Just without the trenchcoat.  
Accordingly I use any or no pronouns and don’t really grasp the usefulness of gender concerning myself.  
In my free time you’ll probably find me on a train, in a forest or near your local internet.  
I also manage the coins of hacc e.V. and sometimes operate cameras.  

You'll find my repositories at https://git.schwe.by .  
This is a purely paticipatory account.
